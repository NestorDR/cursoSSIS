You can find the T-SQL scripts needed to create databases and data tables in the [SQL  folder](https://github.com/NestorDR/cursoSSIS/tree/master/SQL)

This solution was created with Microsoft Visual Studio Comunity 2019  using as data platform Microsfot SQL Server 2019.

For the solution to be fully functional, in some of the ETL packages you must adjust the path of the flat file connection managers. You can do it in the Properties window.
